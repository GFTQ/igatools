\page example_05 Example 5: non-homogeneous Dirichlet conditions

\section Introduction

In this Example we consider a Poisson problem on the quarter annulus domain with a non-constant 
source term and non-homogeneous boundary conditions:
\f{equation}{
  \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      -\Delta u &= f \textrm{   in }\Omega\\
      u &= g \textrm{   on }\partial\Omega\\
    \end{aligned}
  \right.
\f}
We provide an exact strong solution so that the \f$L^2\f$-norm error can be computed. The exact solution is:
\f{equation}{
  u(x,y) = \sin\left(2\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right)+\sqrt(x^2+y^2),
\f}
From \f$u\f$ the source term can be computed:
\f{equation}{
  \begin{align}
    f(x,y) = &-8\pi\cos\left(2\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right)+\\
             &+16\pi^2\left(x^2+y^2\right)\sin\left(2\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right)+\\
             &-\frac{1}{\left(x^2+y^2\right)}.
  \end{align}
\f}
For the non-homogeneous boundary conidition, we split the boundary in the four edges \f$\Gamma_i\f$ and assign
boundary functions \f$g_i\f$ to each of them. The edges and boundary functions indexing (i.e. \f$i=0,...,3\f$) agrees with the face indexing
convention described in \ref example_04. We have:
\f{equation}{
  \begin{align}
    g_0 &= 1,\\
    g_1 &= 2,\\
    g_2 &= \sin\left(2\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right)+x,\\
    g_3 &= \sin\left(2\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right)+y.
  \end{align}
\f}

For the implementation of this problem, the main difficulties rely on the creation of
the boundary functions, while their actual application to the problem requires just three lines of code.
In order to create a custom Function for \f$g_2\f$ and \f$g_3\f$, we need to create a derived class
of FormulaFunction.

\section code05 Description of the program

Ahead of everything there are the new self-explanatory headers:
\snippet example_05 headers

We can proceed with the declaration of the derived class CustomFunction:
\snippet example_05 custom_declaration
As one can notice, we may want to derive the class in the most general way for what concerns the template
parameters. We then declare some type aliases for practical reasons. Notice that we use the Point type
for the evaluation points and the Value type for the result. The only variable we need is a function pointer. In this variable
the user-provided function will be stored. The user-provided function is defined point-wise: it takes a Point
and gives back a Value.

We provide two constructor:
\snippet example_05 custom_constructor
The first one is the default constructor and requires only the domain (it is a mandatory derivation of
the Function class), while the other takes also the function pointer as input parameter. Notice that
the constructors are private, as we will define and use the familiar <tt>const_create()</tt> methods.

The actual method that perfmorms the element-wise computation is <tt>evaluate_0</tt>:
\snippet example_05 custom_evaluator
It just implements a point-loop where each evaluation is a call of the user-provided function stored in
<tt>funct_D0</tt>.

The class FormulaFunction is abstract and needs two other derived methods for derivatives,
in this example lazily implemented as not used at all:
\snippet example_05 custom_not_implemented

At last, the public methods: the promised <tt>const_create</tt> and the mandatory <tt>print_info</tt> that
prints some useful informations. We inspect here only the <tt>const_create</tt>, so that the reader
can notice the usage of the SharedPtrConstnessHandler class, for which we refer to the documentation. Here
is the creator:
\snippet example_05 custom_public

We have a class for the implementation of custom functions. We will use the <tt>quarter_annulus</tt> function for
the construction of the reference domain (see previous examples). The class PoissonProblem is devoted to
the creation of spline spaces, the system assemble, solving, computing the \f$L^2\f$-error and saving the results.
It is a templated class on the problem dimension, as there is no need of implementing it for a specific dimension.
Here is the declaration along with the class variables:
\snippet example_05 poisson_declaration
Most of the variables should be familiar to the reader. The two new entries are a quadrature rule <tt>face_quad</tt> for
the integration on the boundary (notice the template parameter) and the container <tt>dirichlet_cond</tt>. We will explain
the creation and usage of the container later.




\section Exercises
-# Using a coefficient
-# Using a coefficient matrix
-# modify the code to deal with \f$f\f$ being identically 5.
\section Remarks
-# As this class does not use grid except for the constructor
we could have written the longer single line
